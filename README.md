Southern Polytechnic State University Capstone Group Project

SETUP:
After pulling the repo you must create a dev_settings.py file in the capstone directory. This file will hold all the information needed to connect your database. It has been orgnazied this way so that none of your personal information will be uploaded to the github repo.

Template for dev_settings.py
ADMIN_USER = ''
ADMIN_EMAIL = ''

DB_ENGINE = ''
DB_NAME = ''
DB_USER = ''
DB_PASSWORD = ''

IGNORE YOU IDE FILES:
If you look in the .gitignore file you will notice *.idea which is ignoring all IntelliJ or PyCharm IDE related files. Please do not get this repo messy with all your useless garbage!!!
